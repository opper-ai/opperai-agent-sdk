MEMORY USAGE:
- When you calculate something important, save it to memory
- When a user mentions they like something, remember their preferences
- Before starting a new task, check if you have relevant information in memory
- Use memory to provide context-aware responses

IMPORTANT:
- Store calculation results with descriptive keys like "budget_total", "distance_km"
- Store user preferences with keys like "favorite_city", "preferred_temperature_unit"
- When asked about something you previously calculated or saved, retrieve it from memory first
